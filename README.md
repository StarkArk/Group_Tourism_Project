Overview
An exploration of New York City short term rentals and prospects for real estate investing on behalf of interested
Hoteliers.

  Three Questions are addressed:

    Has New York City rental housing recovered from Covid?

    How will the recent NYC ban on short term rentals affect the availability of short term rentals?

    Where should a prospective Hotelier invest to best take advantage of a drop in short term rentals?

Background
  The NYC Ban
  On September 5th 2023, New York began enforcing a ban on short-term rentals. Stays that are less than 30 days.

  In order to legally comply and operate, hosts who wish to have short term rentals must:
  - Register with the city
  - Display a valid registration on their listing.
  - Host must share their data with the city
    - Host Info: Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Profile ID, Profile URL, Total Amount the platform transmitted
    to host, account name.
    - For the listing: Address, Listing Name, ID number, URL, Type of place, total number of nights booked.
  - Hotels must also comply.
  - No more than two paying guests at a time
  - Guest must have free and unobstructed access to all rooms and exits.   - Internal doors cannot have key locks that allow guests to leave and
  lock their room behind them.

  Covid
  The effects of the Covid Pandemic on New York rental real estate is assumed to have first taken place in 2020.

Data Analysis
  Analysis Topics:

    - Yearly Trends in Review Counts to measure the Covid effect
    - Yearly comparison of Seasonality to measure the Ban effect
    - Listings before/after Ban binned by Minimum Nights
    - Compliance with the Ban one month after the start of enforcement
    - Ban Effect on overall listings in the 5 Boroughs
    - Pricing and Review ratings across Boroughs
    - Correlation between Price and a Guests "Location" Rating
    - A Borough level look at Short Term listings 2022 vs 2023

Conclusion
The hole left from Covid and the NYC Ban is sizable and presents a great opportunity to invest in the short term
rental market.

  Next Steps

  - Validate Initial Findings by way of ground level research through sampling and usage of paid data
  sources, focused on targeted neighborhoods.

  - Creation of a formal business case, which can then be converted into a formal business plan.
